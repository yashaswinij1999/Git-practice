    <h1>Cake</h1>
    <p>
      Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients
      and is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of
      bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple
      or elaborate and which share features with desserts such as pastries,
      meringues, custards, and pies. The most common ingredients include flour,
      sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil, or margarine), a liquid, and a
      leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional
      ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and
      extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary
      ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts, or
      dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream, or
      syrups),[1] iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with
      marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.
