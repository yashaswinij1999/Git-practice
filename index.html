    <h1>Cake</h1>
    Light, fluffy, and covered in frosting—whether it’s a classic chocolate cake
    or something for chocolate lovers, a deliciously moist cake is a staple
    centerpiece for any special occasion. Many of our best cake recipes start
    with the same method: beating butter or shortening with sugar until it’s
    fluffy. These cakes are sometimes called creamed cakes, because the fat and
    sugar are creamed together. Using our Test Kitchen’s tried and true methods,
    we’ll teach you how to make a homemade cake that's so good everyone will
    think you bought it from a fancy bakery. While it takes a bit of time,
    you’re about to learn that none of these steps for making a cake are
    actually very difficult.
