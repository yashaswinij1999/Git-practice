    <p>
      All-Purpose Flour: The structure of the cake. Unlike confetti cake where
      you can use either, do not use cake flour here—when combined with
      ultra-light cocoa powder, cake flour is too fine for this cake.
      Unsweetened Natural Cocoa Powder: Do not use dutch-process cocoa powder.
      If you’re interested, see dutch-process vs natural cocoa powder for an
      in-depth explanation.
