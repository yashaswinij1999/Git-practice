    <h1>Rama</h1>
    <p>
      When Rama was a young boy, he was the perfect son. Later he was an ideal
      husband to his faithful wife, Sita, and a responsible ruler of Aydohya.
      "Be as Rama," young Indians have been taught for 2,000 years; "Be as
      Sita." Prince Rama was the eldest of four sons and was to become king when
      his father retired from ruling.
